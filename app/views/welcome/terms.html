                     <p>(a) The ZeroSum Website. The ZeroSum Website allows you to compete in various contests by choosing the category of the Contest and achieve the highest relative profit to your peers in the competition on actions made through the life of the contest (each a “Contest”). You will have an opportunity to win prizes based on the final ranking you achieved as compared to your competitors according to the relative performance of your actions [actions are composed of buy and sell decisions in a Contest instrument for a given amount (“Trades”)] in the Contest.</p>
                     <p>
                        (b) License to Use the ZeroSum Website. ZeroSum hereby grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use a copy of the ZeroSum Website on a single mobile device or desktop that you own or control and access such copy of the ZeroSum Website solely for your own personal use. 
                        We reserve all rights in and to the ZeroSum Website not expressly granted to you under this Agreement.
                     </p>
                     <p> (c) Fees</p>
                     <ul>
                        <li> ZeroSum Fees. If you compete in a Contest with Entry Fees, we will take a percentage of the total prize pool for such Contest (the “ZeroSum Fees”). All applicable ZeroSum Fees will be made known to you before entering the Contest.</li>
                        <li>•  Entry Fees for Contests. If you choose to compete in Contests with entry fees, you agree to pay any applicable entry fees made known to you before entering into the Contest (the “Entry Fees”). We may use Third-Party Payment Vendors to process your payment of Entry Fees. You warrant and represent that you are the valid owner, or an authorized user, of the debit card, credit card or any other payment card you provide to such Third-Party Payment Vendors, and that all such information is accurate.</li>
                     </ul>
                     <p> We reserve the right to change any of the ZeroSum Fees, or the Entry Fees that we charge, or to institute new or additional fees, at any time upon notice to you.
                        (d) Contest Prizes. Each Contest will run only if we have the total number of contestants required to compete in the Contest and prizes will only be awarded if a Contest is run. We reserve the right to cancel Contests at any time. In the event a Contest is cancelled, we will refund you the applicable Entry Fees for the cancelled Contest. If you are awarded a monetary prize as a result of competing in a Contest, that prize will be available for use or withdrawal at the conclusion of the Contest, pursuant to confirmation by ZeroSum that the Contest was competed and closed without abnormality.

                     <p>In the event that any portion of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable, then such portion shall be construed in accordance with the applicable law as nearly as possible to reflect the original intentions of the parties, and the remainder of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. This section, and the sections entitled ZeroSum Intellectual Property, Indemnification, ZeroSum Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability shall survive the termination of this Agreement. You may not assign this Agreement. No waiver shall be effective unless in writing. Neither the course of conduct between parties nor trade practice shall act to modify any provision of this Agreement. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. In the event of a dispute arising under or relating to this Agreement (each, a “Dispute”), either party may elect to finally and exclusively resolve the dispute by binding arbitration governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”). Any election to arbitrate, at any time, shall be final and binding on the other party. IF EITHER PARTY CHOOSES ARBITRATION, NEITHER PARTY SHALL HAVE THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE SUCH CLAIM IN COURT OR TO HAVE A JURY TRIAL, EXCEPT EITHER PARTY MAY BRING ITS CLAIM IN ITS LOCAL SMALL CLAIMS COURT, IF PERMITTED BY THAT SMALL CLAIMS COURT RULES AND IF WITHIN SUCH COURT’S JURISDICTION. ARBITRATION IS DIFFERENT FROM COURT, AND DISCOVERY AND APPEAL RIGHTS MAY ALSO BE LIMITED IN ARBITRATION. All disputes will be resolved before a neutral arbitrator, whose decision will be final except for a limited right of appeal under the FAA. The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (“JAMS”) pursuant to its then current Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures and in accordance with the Expedited Procedures in those rules, or, where appropriate, pursuant to JAMS’ Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures. All applicable JAMS’ rules and procedures are available at the JAMS website http://www.jamsadr.com. Each party will be responsible for paying any JAMS filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with JAMS rules. Judgment on the arbitrator’s award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. This clause shall not preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or online. If conducted in person, the arbitration shall take place in the United States county where you reside. The parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, to stay a proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator. The parties shall cooperate in good faith in the voluntary and informal exchange of all non-privileged documents and other information (including electronically stored information) relevant to the Dispute immediately after commencement of the arbitration. Nothing in this Agreement will prevent us from seeking injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction as necessary to protect our proprietary interests.
                        You agree that any arbitration or proceeding shall be limited to the Dispute between us and you individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (i) no arbitration or proceeding shall be joined with any other; (ii) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated or resolved on a class action-basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (iii) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons. YOU AGREE THAT YOU MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST US ONLY IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
                        Our failure to act on or enforce any provision of the Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of that provision or any other provision in this Agreement. No waiver shall be effective against us unless made in writing, and no such waiver shall be construed as a waiver in any other or subsequent instance. Except as expressly agreed by us and you in writing, this Agreement constitutes the entire Agreement between you and us with respect to the subject matter, and supersedes all previous or contemporaneous agreements, whether written or oral, between the parties with respect to the subject matter. The section headings are provided merely for convenience and shall not be given any legal import. This Agreement will inure to the benefit of our successors, assigns, licensees, and sub-licensees.
