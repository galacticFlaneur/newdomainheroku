                        <p>ZeroSum is a skill-based contest for traders who are fed up with the current environment of shady brokers and unreasonable fees to trade. Competitors are given the ability to trade a fictional portfolio to showcase their skills as a trader. Skills such as timing, trade sizing, and market views are emphasized as each trader competes to achieve the best performance compared to his or her peers. Competitors are ranked based on their performance to each other determined by the amount of fictional PnL you generated during the Contest. Founded in 2015 a team of former Wall Street traders who were fed up with the current state of trading for everyone not named a Hedge Fund or High Frequency Shop, ZeroSum is headquartered in Chicago, IL. </p>

                        <p>ZeroSum offers both paid and free contests. Contests include multiple arrangements of instruments and types that Competitors can find the Contest that best showcases their edge. These may include:
<ul><li> Instrument Groups, G10 FX, EM FX, Single Instruments </li>
<li>  Duration of Competition </li>
<li>  Number of Participating Competitors </li>
<li> Event Risk over the Competition </ul>

                        <h5 class="m-y-0" style="color: #E0C023;">Is competing on ZeroSum legal?</h5>
                        <p> For the vast majority of residents within the US the answer is YES. According to current Law some residents of the jurisdictions listed below are ineligible at this time. 
Legal residents physically located in any of the 50 states and Washington DC, excluding Arizona, Iowa, Louisiana, Montana, Nevada, and Washington are eligible to open an account and participate in contests offered by ZeroSum. Legal residents of Arizona, Iowa, Louisiana, Montana, Nevada, and Washington (the "Excluded States") are ineligible for prizes offered by ZeroSum.

                        <h5 class="m-y-0" style="color: #E0C023;"> What type of Contests do you offer?</h5><p></p>
                        <p><strong> Tiered </strong></p>
                        <p>Prize values in Tiered contests are based on your final ranking, the top ranking individuals will get the lion’s share of the contest winnings (pays to be good!). The contest tiered payouts will be adjusted according to feedback from our users in order to best serve what you want! </p>

                        <p><strong> 50/50s </strong></p>
                        <p>All Competitors who finish in the top half of the contest as defined by (Total Entrants / 2) will receive an equal payout. For these competitions all top ranking competitors are treated equally for the prize pool and final ranking inside the top half is irrelevant to the awarded prize. </p>

                        <p><strong> Time Based </strong></p>
                        <p>All competitions have a given duration for how long they run. Every competition lets the competitors know during registration when the competition will start and how long it will run for. The final ranking is taken at the conclusion of the contest and any open positions will be marked to the last available market price to determine final ranking.
   These competitions can range anywhere from 5 minutes, (focus on those trades!) to days or even weeks at a time. Again we aim to provide the best possible service for our users and welcome any feedback in regards to which competitions you want to see most!
 </p>

                        <p><strong> Instrument Based </strong></p>
                        <p>Since we understand that you might have an edge in a specific sector or instrument we offer varying types of contests. Competitions have a list of tradeable instruments that are noted during contest registration. The list can range from a single instrument such as EUR/USD where all participants can only trade EUR/USD through the life of the competition. To instrument lists that have a wide range of pairs or securities.  </p>

                         <p><strong> Paid </strong></p>
                        <p>Paid contests require an entry fee and a prize pool offered to competitors at the end of the contest depending the structure of the contest.  </p>

                         <p><strong> Free </strong></p>
                        <p>Free contests do not have an entry fee and do not offer a prize pool. But do allow you bragging rights.  </p>
                     </div>

                        <h5 class="m-y-0" style="color: #E0C023;">How is my rank determined?</h5>
                        <p>In the real world if you are long and the instrument goes up you make a profit, all else being equal. We are interested in taking the ability of you as a trader and quantifying so you can be compared against your peers. How do we do this?
Simple, we give each participant in a contest the same tools and functionality that lets them trade a fictional portfolio on selected instruments and compare how they did against one another. At the end of a competition we rank your fictional portfolio’s profits against all other competitors in your contest. What this does is give us a RELATIVE performance rank of each participant and that rank demonstrates how you preformed against your peers under the same conditions. 
We provide a live leaderboard for the contest, but these ranks are not finalized until the conclusion of the contest where we determine PnL for all open positions by marking them to the most recent price quote we have. 

                        </p>

                     <div class="col-sm-12 m-b-md">
                        <h5 class="m-y-0" style="color: #E0C023;">How are ties handled?</h5>
                        <p>If there is a tie in which PnL is identical between two or more competitors at the end of the competition, then those involved in the tie will evenly split the prize pool. As an example, if 3rd and 4th tied, and the prizes were $10 and $5 respectively, then each competitor would receive $7.50 as the prize payout. We have structured the competitions so that the end results are highly unlikely to be a tie, but in the event it happens the above process will take place. </p>

                        <p> The contest will not take place and all entry fees will be returned to the users. </p>

                        <p>Yes! We have gone the extra mile to bring you real time data. Something that seems easy, but trust us, is not. All prices shown are real time and not delayed (unless otherwise noted). The Leaderboard is delayed a few seconds so that we can run calculations on our back end (fixing this for you shortly!).  </p>

                        <h5 class="m-y-0" style="color: #E0C023;">How do you handle Competitions when the market is closed?</h5>
                        <p>If a competition is ongoing, the contest will be locked until the market re-opens, all positions will be unchanged for the user until price data is restored on Market Open.  </p>

                        <p>No contest PnL’s are finalized until we have the appropriate data to calculate end PnL for each user. After this calculation takes place (as defined above) we will then finalize the position of each competitor for rank. </p>

Any additional amount will be sent via check. ZeroSum will only release withdrawals to a different payment method other than that which was used to make deposit(s) after the aggregate amount of such deposit(s) has already been released back to the credit card(s) or payment method(s) used for the deposit(s).
If you have cancelled your credit or debit card that you have used in the past to deposit on ZeroSum, please contact support@zerosummarkets.com prior to requesting your withdrawal.

                        <p>All ZeroSum competitors are subject to a verification process provided whenever a competitor attempts to withdraw funds. In the event of a dispute as to the identity of a customer, ZeroSum can and does require its competitors to produce a copy of their driver’s license, credit cards, utility bills or passport for identity verification. If a customer cannot validate their identity and account, ZeroSum will not release the funds from the account.act support@zerosummarkets.com prior to requesting your withdrawal.
